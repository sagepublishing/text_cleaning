Websites that might be goldmines but would require some time to explore. 


* European Language Resource Coordincation

  * A lot of legal / official documents translated and sometimes already processed. E.g. IP case law, audits, a lot of legal texts from EU countries (not sure how useful they really are, but it is a *lot* of them, there might be some interesting ones)
  * https://elrc-share.eu

* 
  Clarin


  * List of 24 parliamentary corpora, not all easy access
  * https://www.clarin.eu/resource-families/parliamentary-corpora

  * Reports from the Congressional Research Service — essentially the national legislature’s think-tank. 
  * https://www.everycrsreport.com/

* Supreme court transcripts

  * https://www.oyez.org/

Complementary text data
-----------------------

Texts that are not necessarily directly relevant to political science research but are used for context / complement. E.g. annotate etc.


* Wikipedia or other "ground truth" sources
* Network data
* Dictionaries: e.g. sentiment or emotions to use automated dictionary methods with one click
