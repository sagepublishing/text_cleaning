This page contains links to resources, tools, courses, blogs, newsletters and other interesting things relating to text mining for research.

Tools and software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- This `universal sentence encoder <https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-xling-many/1>`_ apparently is good for clustering sentences or shorter text

See `full list of 80+ tools (web apps, software, packages in R and python) <https://sagepublishing.github.io/sage_tools_social_science/2020/01/20/text-mining.html>`_ with an overview of type and classification of free vs charged.


Books and Textbooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `Computational Social Science with Python <https://github.com/damian0604/bdaca/blob/master/book/bd-aca_book.pdf>`_ by Damian Trilling 
- `Language processing with Python <http://www.nltk.org/book/ch01.html>`_ , by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein and Edward Loper, Copyright © 2019 

Course materials
################

- `Big data and automated content analysis <https://github.com/damian0604/bdaca>`_ by Damian Trilling
- `The python tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html>`_
- `NLP for developers <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ1hzEJE16c&list=PL75e0qA87dlFJiNMeKltWImhQxfFwaxvv>`_ by Rasa
- `Start to end training on wikipedia corpus for topic modeling <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mHy4OSyRf0>`_
- `Tips for computational text analysis from Simon Brown at Berkeley <http://matrix.berkeley.edu/research/tips-computational-text-analysis>`_
- Lessons and materials for teaching text analysis from the `Programming Historian <https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/>`_
- An introduction `on how to use pre-trained vector embeddings <https://www.shanelynn.ie/word-embeddings-in-python-with-spacy-and-gensim/>`_
- For working with shorter texts, like one sentences, where possibly there is just one topic and LDA assumes multiple topics, there is this `GSDMM model <https://towardsdatascience.com/a-unique-approach-to-short-text-clustering-part-1-algorithmic-theory-4d4fad0882e1>`_ with the full pipeline explained `here <https://towardsdatascience.com/short-text-topic-modeling-70e50a57c883>`_


Newsletters
~~~~~~~~~~~

- `Sebastian Ruder's NLP News <http://newsletter.ruder.io/>`_, probably the most comprehensive newsletter out there, covering deep dives in the technical and the economics of mining.
- `The Gradient <https://thegradientpub.substack.com/>`_ are overviews, essays and perspectives on Artificial Intelligence, recent developments and long-term impacts. It is a publication ran by volunteers and open to submissions.



Other interesting resources
